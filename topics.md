These are not listed in the order of when they will be covered, or even the depth in which they will be covered (this is one course, after all). But these are all topics we will be touching on. Some will be covered in class, some in homework, some in lab, and some you will be expected to read on your own.

Expect this list to either shrink, or for some topics to be replaced, as the semester goes on!
